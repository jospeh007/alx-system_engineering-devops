# What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

- It's a seamless experience for the user, but beneath the surface lies a complex journey involving multiple components working together to deliver the requested web page. Let's take a closer look at each step of this process.

### DNS Request:
The journey begins with a Domain Name System (DNS) request. Your browser sends a query to a DNS server to translate the human-readable domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address, which computers use to identify each other on the internet.

### TCP/IP:
Once the DNS server resolves the domain name to an IP address (such as 216.58.194.196 for Google), your browser initiates a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to that IP address. TCP ensures that data packets are reliably transmitted between your computer and the server hosting the website.

### Firewall:
As the TCP connection is established, it may pass through firewalls, which are network security devices designed to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. The firewall ensures that only authorized connections are allowed and protects against unauthorized access or malicious activity.

### HTTPS/SSL:
Since we typed "https://" in the URL, our connection to Google.com is secured using Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) and the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. This encryption ensures that the data exchanged between your browser and Google's servers remains confidential and cannot be intercepted by malicious actors.

### Load-Balancer:
Google serves billions of requests every day, so to distribute the incoming traffic efficiently and prevent overload on any single server, they employ load balancers. These devices distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers, optimizing resource utilization and ensuring high availability and reliability of the service.

### Web Server:
Once the request reaches Google's servers, it is directed to a web server responsible for handling HTTP requests. In Google's case, they likely utilize a vast array of highly efficient web servers to handle the enormous volume of requests they receive.

### Application Server:
After processing the HTTP request, the web server may communicate with one or more application servers to generate the dynamic content of the web page. Google's search engine, for example, relies on complex algorithms and massive datasets stored in their backend systems, which are accessed and processed by application servers.

### Database:
Many web applications, including Google's, rely on databases to store and retrieve information dynamically. In the case of a Google search, the application server may query a database containing indexed web pages and other relevant information to generate the search results.

Finally, the requested web page is assembled, encrypted, and transmitted back to your browser over the established TCP connection. Your browser then interprets the received data, rendering the web page on your screen for you to interact with.
