# Web Infrastructure Description for Readme:

## Application Server vs Web Server:

### Application Server:
An application server is responsible for executing the logic of the web application. It handles dynamic content generation, business logic processing, and interacts with other backend systems such as databases. In our infrastructure, we will allocate a dedicated server for the application server component to ensure efficient processing of application-specific tasks.

### Web Server:
A web server's primary role is to handle incoming HTTP requests from clients (such as web browsers) and serve static content like HTML, CSS, and images. It also can handle certain dynamic content through server-side scripting. We will assign another dedicated server specifically for the web server to efficiently manage and serve static content to users.

## Infrastructure Components:

### 1. Server:
We will utilize a single server to host each component of our infrastructure. This approach ensures better resource isolation and scalability, allowing us to scale each component independently based on its resource requirements.

### 2. Load-Balancer (HAProxy):
To distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers and ensure high availability and reliability, we will incorporate HAProxy as our load balancer. Configuring HAProxy in a clustered setup enhances fault tolerance and scalability by automatically rerouting traffic in case of server failures or overload situations.

### 3. Split Components:
- **Web Server:** The dedicated web server will efficiently handle static content delivery, reducing the load on the application server and improving overall performance.
- **Application Server:** By separating the application logic onto its own server, we ensure optimal resource utilization and scalability for handling dynamic content generation and business logic processing.
- **Database Server:** Although not explicitly mentioned in the requirements, it's essential to include a dedicated database server to manage data storage and retrieval efficiently. Separating the database onto its server ensures better security, performance, and scalability.

## Specifics:

### Load Balancer (HAProxy):
- **Reasoning:** HAProxy ensures high availability and reliability by distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers. Clustering HAProxy instances further enhances fault tolerance and scalability, ensuring uninterrupted service delivery even during server failures or heavy traffic loads.

### Split Components:
- **Reasoning:** Separating components onto dedicated servers improves resource utilization, scalability, and security. It allows each component to scale independently based on its specific requirements, preventing resource contention and bottlenecks. Additionally, isolation enhances security by minimizing the attack surface and simplifying maintenance tasks.

By implementing this infrastructure design, we aim to achieve optimal performance, scalability, and reliability for our Readme web application, ensuring seamless user experiences and efficient management of resources.
